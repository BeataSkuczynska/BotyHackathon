We'll make our economy and country more welcoming to people with disabilities. We all win when everyone gets to share in America's promise.
The ultimate test of our society is how we treat our fellow human beings, especially those who we have previously left behind.
Americans with disabilities deserve the chance to work alongside those without disabilities—to do the same jobs for the same pay &amp; benefits.
We’ve got to build an economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect.
Over 60% of adults with disabilities aren’t in the workplace. We have to fix that. https://t.co/J3Jq21ejtR
None of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up.
Building an inclusive economy is another reason we’ve got to break down systemic racism, including under-investment in communities of color.
When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.
In America, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you.
We need to come together to turn the tide, stop violence, build trust, and give all our kids the chance to grow up safe and healthy.
We've also seen the targeting of police officers—but so many serve every day with courage and honor and are committed to reform.
We have two names to add to a long list of African Americans killed by police officers. It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable.

We have to stand up to this hate.

We have to send a clear message: 
America is better than this.
America is better than Donald Trump.
We're facing a candidate with a history of discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, and led the birther movement.
In a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside-in and the inside-out.
Simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. https://t.co/oZIm2is1lX
When Americans get knocked down, we get right back up again. We refuse to quit—no matter what. 

That’s the spirit we need in this election.

College should be tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone: https://t.co/lkOFcHI4Py
If you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
We can build a cleaner, more resilient electrical grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country.
It’s wrong to tear each other down.
It’s wrong to let income inequality get worse.
It’s wrong to put a loose cannon in charge.
This election isn’t a reality TV show. It shouldn’t be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get on cable news.
You want something to vote for, not just against:

Optimism, not resentment.
Answers, not anger.
Ideas, not insults.
Bridges, not walls.

What Trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. Apologize to the President, and to the American people.
Trump’s birtherism stems from the same innate beliefs that led to discriminating against black tenants early in his career. Can't be undone.
The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can't be unwritten.
Trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first African American president. He can't just take it back.
This shouldn't have to be said: You don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. It doesn’t work. No one buys it.
Again, Trump turns his faults on others. Psychologists call it "projecting." Kids call it "I'm rubber, you're glue." https://t.co/lKDDD0wwsn
When Trump tries to deflect blame for denying that @POTUS was born in America, he is lying. https://t.co/lje3lKrZQy https://t.co/yq9IWnvXUc
Leading the birther movement is deplorable. Attempting to say it "did a great service" to the president who Trump attacked is asinine.
Expressing zero regret for years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory, Trump again appointed himself judge &amp; jury on @POTUS's citizenship.
What Trump just did is a disgrace.

“Let’s reject the cynicism, the bullying, and the divisive rhetoric that my opponent is using to try and make us all afraid of each other.”
Donald Trump looks at women and decides how their looks rate on a scale of one to 10.
"He looks at a Gold Star family and sees them as Muslims, not patriotic Americans.” —Hillary on Trump
"Donald Trump looks at a distinguished judge born in Indiana, and he sees a Mexican, not an American.” —Hillary
Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
We just can’t accept this.
We’ve got to stand up to this.
If we don’t, it won’t stop.
Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple.

Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.
Just yesterday, Trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the United States.
"We know who Donald is. For five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president.” —Hillary

Trump is running the most divisive campaign of our lifetimes.

There’s no innuendo or dog whistles anymore. It’s all out in the open now.
Donald Trump still refuses to say @POTUS was born in America. And this man wants to be our president?

When will he stop this ugliness?
America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look or worship a certain way.
Despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals.
No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if mom or dad will be there when they get home.
"We have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn’t just the smart thing to do—it’s what the American people demand."
Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable child care isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity.
It's wrong when Latinos are 17% of our population and hold only 2% of its wealth.

We've got to connect more Latinos with good jobs.

15. To what extent are you and your family currently contractually tied to payments from foreign business partners, or governments?

9. Have you or your campaign discussed U.S.-Russian relations with the Russian billionaires with whom you've done business?
8. Will you disclose the nature of your personal and business relationships with all of the Russian oligarchs you are “close” to?
7. To what extent would your foreign policy be dictated by potential financial benefits for your business partners? https://t.co/4Nd9KSdTfi

2. How will you handle non-cancelable contractual obligations with parties whose interests conflict with those of the United States?
1. Will you sever ties with your company linked to foreign leaders, questionable organizations, and criminals if you become president?
